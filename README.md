# Designing for Freedom

**Designing for Freedom** is an open, exploratory web project on anarchist principles, system design, and the architecture of freedom. It is a visual, conceptual, and practical toolkit for anyone interested in the question: *what would a politics of cooperation actually look like?*

This project is inspired by the work of David Graeber, Peter Kropotkin, Elinor Ostrom, Ruth Kinna, and others who have contributed to a vision of politics grounded in mutual aid, decentralization, and democratic design.
